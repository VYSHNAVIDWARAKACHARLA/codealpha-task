# Project Title


# Description

This project involves creating a basic voice assistant using Python, enabling users to interact via voice commands. It employs speech recognition for understanding user input and text-to-speech conversion for delivering spoken responses. The assistant supports predefined commands for tasks like weather updates and general knowledge queries. It emphasizes user engagement through personalized interactions and allows for easy expansion with new functionalities. Ultimately, it provides a hands-free and intuitive way for users to interact with their devices.

# Problem

Create a custom voice assistant using Python to
personalize and automate tasks according to your
needs. Python's versatility makes it an excellent choice
for scripting and development, allowing you to build a
voice assistant that can compete with the likes of Siri,
Alexa, and Google Assistant.

# Solution

Creating a custom voice assistant in Python can be a fun and rewarding project. To get started, you'll need to use various libraries and tools to handle speech recognition, natural language processing, and task automation. Here's a basic outline of how you can build a simple voice assistant using Python:

Step 1: Setting Up Environment

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You'll also need to install some Python libraries using pip:

bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio


- SpeechRecognition: For converting speech to text.
- pyttsx3: For converting text to speech.
- pyaudio: For microphone access (you might need to install this separately depending on your system).

Step 2: Speech Recognition

Use the SpeechRecognition library to convert spoken words to text:

python
import speech_recognition as sr

def listen():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = r.listen(source)
    
    try:
        command = r.recognize_google(audio)
        print("You said:", command)
        return command.lower()
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Could not understand audio")
        return ""
    except sr.RequestError:
        print("Could not request results; check your internet connection")
        return ""


Step 3: Text to Speech

Use pyttsx3 to convert text to speech:

python
import pyttsx3

def speak(text):
    engine = pyttsx3.init()
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()


Step 4: Implementing Commands

Define functions for specific tasks your assistant can perform:

python
def greet():
    speak("Hello! How can I assist you today?")

def get_time():
    import datetime
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    time_str = now.strftime("%I:%M %p")
    speak(f"The current time is {time_str}")


def process_command(command):
    if "hello" in command:
        greet()
    elif "time" in command:
        get_time()
    # Add more conditions for other commands...
    else:
        speak("Sorry, I didn't catch that. Can you repeat?")


Step 5: Main Loop

Create a loop to continuously listen for commands:

python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    speak("Initializing...")
    while True:
        command = listen()
        if command:
            process_command(command)


Running the Assistant

Run the Python script. Your assistant will continuously listen for commands and respond accordingly.

This is a basic example to get you started. You can expand and customize your voice assistant by integrating additional functionalities like web scraping, sending emails, controlling smart devices (using libraries like pyautogui or selenium), and more. Remember to handle exceptions, improve speech recognition accuracy, and optimize for your specific use case.
